# Placeholders Warning

alerts you when the "Always Set Placeholders" button in your bank is disabled.

## description

If you're like me, you've grown tired of coming back to your bank, only to realise that in ages past, through the folly of man, you forgot to turn that one button back on that separates order from chaos and distinguishes man from beast.
 
This plugin will do it's best to steer you towards redemption any time this core pillar of civilization is turned off, before your hubris bears torment to your soul as you flounder through the ruins of your once kempt bank.

## configuration

By default, this plugin will **flicker in your eyes** (blink the icon), **whisper in your ear** (send a game message), and **echo in your mind** (send a notification) every time you are in danger. If you don't like what it's doing, you can persuade it to stop.
